# Vehicle Telemetry System

## Overview

The Vehicle Telemetry System is a C++ project designed to simulate and monitor various vehicle parameters using object-oriented programming principles. The system includes components such as sensors, electronic control units (ECUs), and a dashboard to display real-time data. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of vehicle diagnostics and telemetry using modern C++ features.

## Features

- **Sensors**: Implements various sensors to monitor speed, fuel level, temperature, battery charge, and radar distance.
- **ECUs**: Contains different electronic control units responsible for controlling the vehicle's engine, brakes, and transmission.
- **Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface to display real-time telemetry data.
- **Diagnostics**: A system for running diagnostics on vehicle parameters and logging any issues.
- **Adaptive Cruise Control**: Automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed based on the distance to the vehicle ahead.
- **Logging**: All operations and sensor readings are logged for analysis.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: g++ (version 7.0 or higher recommended)
- **Graphviz**: For generating UML diagrams (optional)
- **Doxygen**: For generating documentation (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim-Elsayed-27/Vehicle-Telemetry
   cd Vehicle-Telemetry
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if required):

   ```bash
   sudo apt install graphviz doxygen
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   make
   ```

## Usage

To run the Vehicle Telemetry System, execute the following command:

```bash
./vehicle.exe
```

The system will initialize the components and display the dashboard with real-time telemetry data.

## Documentation

To generate documentation, including UML diagrams, run:

```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in the `docs` directory.
